\--- Day 12: JSAbacusFramework.io ---
-------------------------------------

Santa's Accounting-Elves need help balancing the books after a recent order. Unfortunately, their accounting software uses a peculiar storage format. That's where you come in.

They have a [JSON](http://json.org/) document which contains a variety of things: arrays (`[1,2,3]`), objects (`{"a":1, "b":2}`), numbers, and strings. Your first job is to simply find all of the _numbers_ throughout the document and add them together.

For example:

*   `[1,2,3]` and `{"a":2,"b":4}` both have a sum of `6`.
*   `[[[3]]]` and `{"a":{"b":4},"c":-1}` both have a sum of `3`.
*   `{"a":[-1,1]}` and `[-1,{"a":1}]` both have a sum of `0`.
*   `[]` and `{}` both have a sum of `0`.

You will not encounter any strings containing numbers.

What is the _sum of all numbers_ in the document?

Your puzzle answer was `119433`.

The first half of this puzzle is complete! It provides one gold star: \*

\--- Part Two ---
-----------------

Uh oh - the Accounting-Elves have realized that they double-counted everything _red_.

Ignore any object (and all of its children) which has any property with the value `"red"`. Do this only for objects (`{...}`), not arrays (`[...]`).

*   `[1,2,3]` still has a sum of `6`.
*   `[1,{"c":"red","b":2},3]` now has a sum of `4`, because the middle object is ignored.
*   `{"d":"red","e":[1,2,3,4],"f":5}` now has a sum of `0`, because the entire structure is ignored.
*   `[1,"red",5]` has a sum of `6`, because `"red"` in an array has no effect.

Although it hasn't changed, you can still [get your puzzle input](12/input).
